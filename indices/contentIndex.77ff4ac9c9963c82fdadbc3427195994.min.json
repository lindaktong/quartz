But it has not been sinking in. Sometimes I crave nonfiction, but other times I want something more emotive. Right now feels like the latter. I had my wisdom teeth removed this morning, and _A Thousand Years_ was the book I carted around for the past few days - on Uber rides, in waiting rooms, and on the dentist’s chair. I’ve been crying all afternoon.\n\nYiyun was born in 1972 , only a few years after my parents. Her stories inhabit the world I imagine that they grew up in. When I was reading, I found myself translating her vocabulary back to Chinese: _zuanshi-wanglaowu_ (钻石王老五_),_ soft persimmons (软柿子)…I could go on. I know they are authentic sayings, but they feel like anachronisms because I have never heard them colloquially.\n\nMost of all, I was struck by how much pain her characters were in. Death, illness, and unhappy marriages are prominent themes. My favorite stories were “Son” and “Death Is Not a Bad Joke If Told the Right Way.”\n\nIn “Son,” Han, a gay graduate student, comes home to his religious Chinese mother. At church, they meet two young children begging for money. The mother gives the children money on the condition that they come to church with her, insisting that “it can only benefit them.” Han, knowing that the children are employed by a parent or some minder to beg, offers to give them double the amount if they do not go to church, an offer which they accept eagerly. The boy beggar is hit by a car on that same day, an event that feels as absurd as it is tragic.\n\nThis story resonated with me because my mom preaches in the same way that Han’s mother does. Han reminds her, “Marx, your old god, says religion is the spiritual opium,” something my dad used to say constantly before he, too, converted. He points out that she hasn’t truly read the stories in the Bible, even when he has. He accuses her of being incapable of “[using her] own brain to think,” as she would defer to her husband before his death and now she defers to him. But I can sense the futility in Han’s logic. All the things that Han says are true, but in the end, one could argue that the boy dies because of his clever stubbornness. I have been thinking a lot about if I should yield to my mom’s proselytism. I don’t want to, but I also don’t want to become Han.\n\nIn “Death Is Not a Bad Joke If Told the Right Way,” a young girl with a nuclear physicist father[1](https://lindasbookshelf.substack.com/p/a-thousand-years-of-good-prayers#footnote-1-51472553) spends her summers away from home with a family friend. In Beijing, her family is locked away in a research compound, but in this village, she is free to roam. Her adoptive parents save her from her own precociousness, and she develops an enduring affection for them.\n\nI think good stories are emotional journeys, and that was what reading this book felt like. I accept that I am running away.\n\n### 💬 Quotes that stuck\n\n-   “They did not invite guests to their home; after a while, they stopped having friends.”\n    \n-   “He pays for the two books and walks back to his room. He studies the dictator’s portrait and compares it with his own face in the mirror, still perfect from every angle. He sighs and plunges into the yellow book, devouring it like a starved man. When his erection becomes too painful, he forces himself to drop the book and pick up the red one.” - brilliant\n    \n-   “Every place is a good place. Only time goes wrong.”\n    \n-   “They had loved the stories, the bigness of the book that made their worries tiny and transient.”\n    \n-   “It’s not easy to shut up in America. They value you not by what’s inside you, but by what’s pouring out of your mouth,” Han says. “Yes, of course,” Han’s mother says, quickly agreeing. “But Baba would say you have to learn to listen before you open your mouth. Baba would say _the more you talk, the less you gain._”\n    \n-   “Han knows it’s the boy. It has to be the boy, ready to deceive anyone who is willing to be deceived. The boy will remain a son and never become a father. He will be forgotten by the crowd once his blood is rinsed clean from the ground; his sister will think of him but soon she will forget him, too. He will live on only in Han’s memory, a child punished not for his own insincerity but someone else’s disbelief.”\n    \n-   “I just laugh when the roosters finally escape his grip, fluttering their wings around in our apartment. In a few minutes my father will catch them again, and in a few hours they will fill our stomachs and then be forgotten. _Life goes at small baby steps when one is young, but then it picks up speed and flies._”\n    \n-   “Death is not a bad joke if told the right way, yet I do not see a right way. I start to understand what Mrs. Pang said about death long ago, that one would rather see beloved ones die instead of suffering. It comforts me that she would not have to see Mr. Pang’s death, and have to listen to the jokes told by the Song boys. It comforts me that not one more scratch would have to be left on her life, and I am the only one to live with the awkward joke that Mr. Pang’s death makes.”\n    \n-   “If you grew up in a language that you never used to express your feelings, it would be easier to take up another language and talk more in the new language. It makes you a new person.”","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/AI-Superpowers":{"title":"AI Superpowers","content":"\nI got my third recommendation for _AI Superpowers_ a couple of weeks back (#iykyk), and conveniently had many copies lying around the house, so I decided to pick up this book. I ended up zipping through this book; I feel like it only took me around four hours to read?\n\nThere were a lot of things that I loved about this book, including the comparison of the Chinese and American startup ecosystems. Kai-Fu Lee also did a really great job of unpacking the things I've observed anecdotally into concrete theory. I had realized the street pedlers in China ask for money via Wechat Wallet, but I did not connect that intuitively with China’s leap in mobile payment platforms.\n\n---\n\nThese were my three main ideas:\n\n### **#1:** If data is the biggest determinant for how deep learning algorithms perform, data will be the most valuable asset today.\n\nThe industrial revolution fueled by electricity is similar to today’s AI revolution, which thrives on an ecosystem of data, entrepreneurs, AI scientists, and AI friendly policy. What will be the new Standard Oil, and who will be the new John D.?\n\n### #2: China’s startup ecosystem and government are accelerating advances in AI at a far greater speed than America.\n\nWhy?\n\n-   The US government deliberately takes a laissez-faire approach to entrepreneurship and is slashing funding for basic research. The Chinese government invests proactively and lends funding + legitimacy to entrepreneurship.\n    \n-   Profit hungry entrepreneurs mimicking competitors ➡️ relentless iteration, cost control, flawless execution, raising funds at exaggerated valuations\n    \n-   Different goals in entrepreneurship: Silicon Valley: liberal arts + innovative thinking ➡️ clean digital platforms; China’s scarcity mentality: getting rich ➡️ implementation heavy approach, vertically integrated, recruiting users\n    \n-   American startups favor the “light approach” - sharing information, closing knowledge gaps, connecting people digitally; Chinese startups favor the “heavy approach” - recruit each seller, handle goods, run the delivery team, control payment (ex. mobile payments market)\n    \n\n### #3: AI will have an enormous impact on global economics and governance, including increased economic stratification between nations and castes.\n\nIf AI will replace 40-50% of jobs in America within the next 15 years, we need government leaders who are well-versed enough in technology to respond to the impacts of this change. In developing countries, AI-driven automation will undercut their historical economic advantage: cheap labor. Smart cities like Hebei’s Xiong'an will shift power from government to tech companies.\n\n---\n\nIn the end, I had two big takeaways from _AI Superpowers_.\n\nOne, which Kai-Fu Lee also spoke about in his TED Talk, is the idea that AI, rather than merely eliminating jobs, will give us the freedom to do the work that makes us human. AI can optimize but not innovate. The jobs that will be most protected are creatives and caregivers.\n\nTwo, to always put family first, and to never let my work ethic take precedence over love for my family. I hope I will not need a terminal illness to remind me to prioritize eulogy virtues over resume virtues. No matter how influential I become, the people closest to me are the ones I will have the most impact on\n\nOverall, this book was a fascinating read. My goal in the future is to be well-versed enough in technology to be dangerous. Maybe that will be investing, maybe that will be taking companies public. In either case, I want to use my strengths as a Third Culture Kid. We’ll see. :)\n\n---\n\n### **📚 Books I want to read**\n\n-   _Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built_, Duncan Clark\n    \n-   _Folding Beijing_ (北京折叠), Hao Jingfang (郝景芳)\n    \n-   I really want my Chinese to be good enough so that I can go back to reading in Chinese again :/\n    \n\n### **💡 Things + people I want to learn more about!**\n\nPeople:\n\n-   Marvin Minsky\n    \n-   John McCarthy\n    \n-   Herb Simon\n    \n-   Geoff Hinton - deep learning, computer vision\n    \n-   李克强 (Li Keqiang) - 大众创业, 万众创新(双创) - Mass Entrepreneurship, Mass Innovation\n    \n-   Connie Chan, Andreesen Horowitz\n    \n-   Angela Wang’s [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_wang_how_china_is_changing_the_future_of_shopping) on Chinese e-commerce from October 2017\n    \n-   Sebastian Thrun - Kitty Hawk, Udacity, Google X (still has strong ties to the university for sure)\n    \n\nThings:\n\n-   Hidden Markov models\n    \n-   deep learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning\n    \n-   Lean Startup Model (27) - rapid product development cycles to see if a proposed business model is viable; business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning\n    \n\n-   _mission-driven_ (new idea or idealistic goal with clean mission statements) vs. _market-driven_ (make money, adopt any model, go into any business)\n    \n-   _Moravec’s Paradox_ (166) - high-motor activities are the most difficult to automate\n    \n-   _O2O - “online-to-offline”_ - turning online actions into offline resources (Meituan - ride-hailing, food-delivery)\n    \n-   The four waves of AI:\n    \n    -   internet (data) - AI algorithms as recommendation engines run on labeled data\n        \n    -   business (finance/banking) - trading algorithms\n        \n    -   perception (face/voice recognition) - blended environments (Online-Merge-Offline), the next step after O2O\n        \n    -   autonomous (robots) - ex. self-driving cars, packing robots\n        \n\n### **❓Questions I have after reading AI Superpowers:**\n\n-   Who took Alibaba public?

Biz dev deals and distribution were a lot more important and different than it is now. It wasn't like you could just have an idea for a company, spin something up on AWS, put it on the Internet, and get distribution for free on social. It didn't work that way. You needed deals in place.\n-   Kleiner Perkins was unquestioned the best venture firm at the time, but they weren't the only top tier firm in the sort of bulge bracket of proto VC firms at that point in time.\n    -   Sequoia had done Cisco, about to do Yahoo.\n    -   Greylock based out of Boston.\n    -   Venrock: the venture arm of one of the Rockefeller family offices\n\n## Technology Venture Investors and Meryl Pickard Anderson\n\n-   Technology Venture Investors (TVI) and Meryl Pickard Anderson (MPA) shared the same office building on Sandhill Road.\n-   TVI had the unique honor of being the only venture capital investor in [[Microsoft]], investing one million dollars to own five percent of the company.\n-   MPA had done well for itself, having done investments in Palm Pilot, semiconductor companies, and Rampus.\n-   Conversations began within the two firms about restructuring the ownership structure of the firms, as the founders and senior partners had made their money and junior investors were doing all the deals.\n-   A quick digression was made about the economics of a venture firm, which includes the fund and the carry within a fund, as well as the management company.\n-   The management company is typically an LLC owned and controlled by the founding partners, and the fees flow into the management company.\n-   The split of the carry in any individual fund tends to reflect ownership in the management company, but these are two wholly different entities.\n-   The management company owners decide how the fees get paid out, and typically this would be high numbers.\n\n\n\n\n# First 4 Partners\n## [[Bob Kagle]]\n\n-   Bob Kagle grew up in Flint, Michigan, and was the first member of his family to go to college. He attended General Motors University, a training school for members of General Motors employees' families.\n-   After graduating, he went to [[Stanford Business School]], where he met [[David Marquardt]], who invited him to join Technology Venture Investors.\n-   Bob worked at TVI for 10 years, and was involved in the Microsoft deal.\n-   Bob had an almost religious fervor that anything other than an equal partnership was morally wrong for a venture capital firm.\n-   Bob did not foresee the powerful knock-on effects of his stance, but was motivated by a sense of fairness and proper rewards for proper work.\n-   After TVI, [[David Marquardt]] went on to found August Capital, and Bob went on to found [[Benchmark]].\n\n## [[Bruce Dunlevie]]\n\n-   Bruce had gone on to work in the PC industry and then at Goldman Sachs before joining Meryl Pickard.\n-   Bruce was a few years younger than Bob and did not have the same safety net as Bob.\n-   Bob approached Bruce with the idea of leaving Meryl Pickard and starting a firm together, but Bruce was hesitant due to lack of investment capacity.\n-   Bruce and his fellow young partner at Meryl Pickard, D. Racliff, discussed the idea of equal economics.\n-   Bob's offer to Bruce to be an equal partner showed an incredible vote of confidence and maturity.\n-   Bruce and Andy within Meryl Pickard had conversations about what their next fund would look like, and the idea of equal partnership seemed to have made its way around the building.\n\n## Recruiting [[Kevin Harvey]] and [[Val Vaden]]\n-   Bruce and Andy discussed the need to recruit more people to join the firm.\n-   They considered recruiting a well-known GP from Graylock, but decided against it.\n-   Bruce suggested recruiting Kevin Harvey, a former entrepreneur who he had worked with and gone to Rice University with.\n-   Kevin had started two companies, the first of which had been acquired by Apple.\n-   Bruce and Andy approached Kevin and he agreed to join the firm.\n-   They also recruited Val, who had gone to GSB and worked in venture, but had moved on to do software company buyouts.\n-   With the addition of Val, the four founders of Benchmark were complete.\n## [[Val Vaden]]\n-   Val Vaden was the fifth founder of Benchmark, coming from the buyout industry.\n-   Val's investment style did not fit with the rest of the firm, and he left the equal partnership at the end of 1996.\n-   Benchmark had invested about 16 million in companies by the end of 1996.\n-   Despite the partnership transition, Benchmark carried themselves with incredible decorum and discretion.\n-   Val was still listed on the website in January 1997, with a bio that mentioned his focus on technology special situations.\n-   Val went on to establish Vector Capital, and was part of a few other venture firms over the years.\n-   Heading into 1997, the future of Benchmark was uncertain.\n-   To get the swagger back, the four remaining partners decided to replace Val and recruited Dave Burn from Ramsey Burn and Associates, the most aggressive and hyper competitive executive recruiter in Silicon Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Benchmark Fund One\n-   Benchmark Capital was founded by four partners: Bob, Andy, Bruce, and Kevin.\n-   They raised their first fund, Fund One, in 1995.\n-   The fund was 85 million dollars, which is equivalent to around 150-160 million dollars today.\n-   The fund was met with mixed reactions from the LP community, with some loving the idea and some hating it.\n-   The main issue of contention was the premium carry, as the LP community felt that fees should be going down, not up.\n-   Stanford, the alma mater of the four founders, blackballed the fund.\n-   Bob read James Collins' book \"Built to Last\" and handed a copy to each LP as they pitched the fund.\n-   The fund was slightly oversubscribed, and the four partners started investing.\n\n## Dave Bern\n-   Dave Bern was an executive recruiter from Westchester County, New York.\n-   He had a \"Jerry Maguire\" type story, and was able to become the number one retained executive search CEO recruiter in Silicon Valley.\n-   Bruce Dunleavy from Benchmark Capital flew out to Westchester and convinced Dave to join Benchmark.\n-   Dave's first deal was Web Van, an e-commerce business that would sell online everything for everyday needs.\n-   Web Van was founded by Louie Borders, who wanted to build a modern [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/).\n\n## Web Van\n-   Web Van had ambitious plans to be the \"everything store\" and compete with [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/).\n-   Benchmark Partners, especially the original partners, were pushing Louie Borders to scale down and just focus on food.\n-   Dave Bern was sold on the idea of making big bets and left his successful executive search firm to join Benchmark.\n-   Benchmark and Sequoia split a 7 million dollar round, with each getting 10% of the company.\n-   Web Van went public and traded up to an 8 billion dollar market cap.\n-   Benchmark and Sequoia had the potential to make a great risk-adjusted bet, but were likely locked up before the dot com crash.\n-   The bet was a great example of a high-risk, high-return venture capital investment.\n-   Pierre Omidyar had been working on the project for a few years prior to June 1997.\n\n## eBay\n-   Bruce Dunleavy from Maryll Picker Danderson and Air was an investor in the company Ink, a pen computing company.\n-   After Ink, Pierre Omidyar went to General Magic, where he started tinkering around on the early internet and created a collection of internet services called eBay for Electronic Bay Area.\n-   One of the five or so main things on the site was Auction Web, which became eBay.\n-   Piers and Jeff asked users to pay a small listing fee to keep the lights on, and famously, users sent checks to Piers' apartment.\n-   Piers and Jeff went around Sandhill pitching the company to VCs, and Benchmark and Bruce Dunleavy were interested.\n-   They gave Piers and Jeff a term sheet to invest 6.7 million total in the company in a series A financing at a 20 million dollar pre-money valuation.\n-   Night Ritter, a large newspaper conglomerate, had a competing term sheet, which was an acquisition offer.\n-   At this point, eBay was growing 10% a month and was profitable.\n\n## Equity Back Loans\n-   Benchmark structured equity back loans to Pierre and Jeff in the amount of 750,000 dollars each as a way to incentivize them not to take the acquisition offer from Night Ritter.\n-   This was reported by the Washington Post after the IPO of eBay.\n-   It was also reported by the SEC filings that in addition to the equity investment that Benchmark made, there was also some kind of equity back loans to give them the ability to whatever they made on the appreciation of the shares that they got as a part of the direct investment.\n-   It has also been heard from a podcast that three of the six was used as a secondary, 50% of the investment round.\n-   There has also been speculation that there was no secondary and that it doesn't exist at all.\n-   It is believed that there was at least something, and there is enough smoke around the equity back loans to suggest that there was a secondary transaction.\n-   This allowed the entrepreneurs to take some money off the table, so they didn't sell the company for 50 million dollars and instead let everybody make 50 billion dollars.\n-   Benchmark was the only VC term sheet and the only ones willing to structure a deal like this.\n\n## Equity Back Loans (cont.)\n-   Benchmark was willing to structure a deal that allowed the entrepreneurs to take some money off the table without selling the company.\n-   This allowed Benchmark to retain some carry after the eBay investment.\n-   It is believed that there was at least something, and there is enough smoke around the equity back loans to suggest that Benchmark was the only VC term sheet.\n\n## Equal Partnership\n\n-   Benchmark marketed heavily around the concept of equal partnership, which was a stark contrast to John Doerr and KPCB.\n-   This equal partnership was reflected in the economics of the firm, as well as the way they interacted with portfolio companies.\n-   The equal partnership model created a culture of trust within the firm, as there was no incentive to claim credit for anything.\n-   This trust also led to a sense of teamwork, as the most competitive people were forced to work together.\n\n## Incentives\n\n-   David Byrne, Bob K. Gold, Bruce Dunleby, Kevin Harvey, and Andy Radcliffe all made the same amount of money on eBay, demonstrating the economic incentive of the equal partnership model.\n-   However, the most salient incentive on a day-to-day basis was the impact of the decisions on their own career trajectories.\n-   Introducing a secondary incentive of becoming senior widened the gap between the older and current generations, and could lead to misalignment.\n-   The only way this model works is if everyone brings the same amount of value to the partnership, otherwise the gap between those who are bringing it and those who are not will widen.\n-   This model is delicate and requires an unbelievable support system for the partners to succeed.\n\n## Psychological Safety\n\n-   It is critical for a board member to feel psychological safety in their partnership in order to do the things they think are right without conflicting incentives.\n-   This is a rare quality to find in a board member, and it is essential for the success of the partnership.\n-   Rich Barton, a former venture partner at Benchmark, noted that the culture of cooperation and trust at Benchmark is a model for entrepreneurs to bring into their company.\n-   This culture spills over into the portfolio company relationship, with frequent communication between the board member and the entrepreneur.\n-   This tight-knit relationship is essential for maintaining world-class performance, but it will not scale.\n\n## Expansion Strategies\n\n-   Rich Barton noted that the partners at Benchmark had a debate about whether to expand their operations.\n-   Some partners argued that they should hire associates and junior partners, and scale up their capacity.\n-   Others argued that they should focus on their existing model and not fix what wasn't broken.\n-   Rich Barton noted that other firms had been successful with different strategies, such as Sequoia's expansion into multiple continents and Andreessen Horowitz's focus on Web 3.\n-   Benchmark tried a variety of strategies, including corporate partnerships, international expansion, and raising larger funds.\n-   However, the one thing they stayed true to was not bringing on junior partners.\n-   Rich Barton noted that the other firms that were successful with different strategies had someone who could make a call and take the time to travel and find the right partners.\n\n## Bill Gurley\n\n-   Bill Gurley was identified as the perfect candidate for the sixth partner due to his experience in the industry.\n-   He had been a venture capitalist long enough to have burned through all the capital being a bad VC, but still had 20 years of running room left in his career.\n-   He was also fiercely competitive but also an unbelievable teammate.\n-   His history was perfect for the role, having started his career as an engineer at Compaq, then going to Wall Street and writing Above the Crowd.\n-   He originally started Above the Crowd by taking over the slot of someone who sent out a weekly fax, and then added to the contact list from the Pom Pilot with fax numbers.\n-   He eventually also started writing for Fortune.\n\n## Bill Gurley\n\n-   Bill joined Hummer Windblad and spent 18 months there as a venture capitalist.\n-   He was one of the rare female-led venture firms at the time.\n-   People said having someone like Bill on your board was like bringing in a new co-founder, as he was always working on behalf of the company intellectually and executionally.\n-   He was known for his Calvinist work ethic.\n-   He was known for being both analytical and willing to take risks.\n-   He was known for investing in both consumer and enterprise companies, but became known for his investments in marketplaces.\n-   Bill Gurley was known for his deep understanding of financial statements, pricing power, and take rates.\n-   He was able to recognize the mispricing in the Series A market and took advantage of it.\n-   Benchmark was not architected to build a company like Y Combinator, but they recognized the shift in the market and took advantage of it.\n-   They raised a billion dollar fourth fund and before that the first fund was 85, the second was 150, and the third was 175.\n-   They expanded internationally first to Europe and then to Israel, with Bruce spending a lot of his time in London for the first year.\n-   They recruited seven partners to come in and run the international funds, but the separate Europe fund and a separate Israel fund both structured the same way but separate partnerships.\n-   The upside benefit of the trade-off of running a partnership like Benchmark was that the partners were able to spend all their time on the field, making investment decisions and helping portfolio companies.\n\n## Missed Opportunities\n\n-   Bill talks about one of his biggest regrets being that Benchmark failed to pursue Google when they had the opportunity.\n-   Benchmark also missed out on Skype, which was a much smaller miss but still a big miss for a different reason.\n-   Benchmark also missed out on Facebook due to a conflict of interest with Franster. Mark Zuckerberg was reportedly fond of the Benchmark team, but they were unable to pursue the investment.\n\n## Refounding of the Firm\n\n-   Peter Fenton joins Benchmark from Excel, which had just done Facebook.\n-   Peter wasn't directly involved in the Facebook investment, but it was part of that relationship in DNA.\n-   The existing group of GPs at Benchmark, and in particular Bill, found that Peter had already been to all the companies they were interested in.\n-   Peter's dad is Knoll Fenton, who was an entrepreneur and then founded Trinity Ventures.\n-   Peter, Bill, and the other GPs go on a spree of recruiting to inject a little giddy up back into Benchmark.\n-   The most impressive lineup of venture capitalists join the same firm, which retrospectively feels like the Heat.\n-   David Byrne, Eddie Rachliffe, and Alex Pulcansky step back and don't take tail economics, meaning they're out of the management company and no longer have formal decision making power in the firm.\n-   The current ownership structure of the management company transfers to the current GPs and they don't take carry in the new fund.\n-   They keep working and having carry in the boards from the old funds and they're big LPs in the future funds.\n\n## Peter Fenton Joins Benchmark\n\n-   Peter Fenton joins Benchmark as a Baby GP.\n-   He had GP economics in the Facebook fund and was walking away from that to join Benchmark.\n-   It was an emotional decision for Peter to join Benchmark as he had to decide if he really believed in the refounding of the firm and the refocusing on the model.\n-   Peter went on to do investments in Twitter, Doctors, Hortonworks, New Relic, Elastic, Quip, and Friend Feed.\n\n## Mitt Lasky Joins Benchmark\n\n-   Mitt Lasky joins Benchmark as the next partner.\n-   He had been a founder and CEO of a game studio and early mobile games company called Jam-datt.\n-   Bill had led the series C in and was on Mitt's board.\n-   Jam-datt had gone public and then had gotten acquired by EA.\n\n## Matt Coler Joins Benchmark\n\n-   Matt Coler joins Benchmark from Facebook, where he was employee number five.\n-   He was also an employee at LinkedIn before that.\n-   Matt is the single best person at understanding consumer social products and consumer psychology in the entire world.\n\n## Matt Coler's Contributions to Benchmark\n\n-   Matt Coler's contributions to Benchmark included his understanding of mobile advertising, which he saw as a potential for a TV-like experience with the added benefit of data and location.\n-   He also identified the dynamics behind Uber before Bill Gurley invested in it.\n-   Matt's quote, \"Our job is venture capitalist is not to see the future but to see the present very clearly,\" became a truism of venture at that moment in time.\n-   He also identified the potential of Series A investing and the difference between formation stage and seed investing.\n-   Matt's investments in Instagram and Asana paid off hugely for the partnership, with Instagram returning the fund on the investment.\n-   He also identified the potential of the smartphone becoming a remote control for the real world.\n-   By the end of Fund Six, it was clear that there was something special going on.\n-   This led to Fund Seven, which was a perfectly gelled group of GPs with expertise in all the things that were going to flourish in the next decade.\n\n## Swashbuckling Insanity\n\n-   Everyone knew exactly what to look for and prices it appropriately.\n-   They had the swagger. They knew they had a secret. They knew they had the right team. They knew they had gelled as a team.\n-   They were willing to just go, run and not overthink things and play the game on the field. It was a perfect balance of gut and intellectualism.\n-   This fund is ridiculous, with investments in Uber, Snap, Discord, Stitch Fix, Duo Security, Elastic, Next Door, and We Work.\n-   A quote from talking to folks part of the firm and other enterprises was \"swashbuckling insanity\" in a good way in every dimension.\n-   The Fab 4 era had the very best marketplace investor in history in Bill Gurley, Matt Cola who helped create the DNA of the modern social media company, one of the best games investors to ever live investing in games with Michalaski, and Peter Fenton as a utility player and total shark across all categories.\n-   In March of 2015, Forbes came out with an article called \"The Benchmark Way\" chronicling the Fab 4 era and all the companies they had invested in.\n-   Benchmark knows how and when to sell in addition to how to identify these phenomenal companies.\n-   The Benchmark philosophy is that they don't want to hamstring the next generation with any of their decisions.\n-   In 2018, when a Wall Street Journal piece came out, their holding in Uber was worth 8 billion dollars, which alone would have 16x the fund.\n-   Benchmark sold almost half of its stake in Snap and realized a billion dollars in gains.\n-   They also sold $900 million worth of Uber shares to Soft Bank and at that point still owned 7 billion as of 2018.\n-   Benchmark was instrumental in encouraging and pushing Snap to go public as soon as they did.\n\n## Benchmark's Involvement with Uber\n\n-   Benchmark invested in Uber in 2011 with a $10 million Series A at a $60 million post-money valuation.\n-   Travis Kalanick pitched Uber to Sequoia Capital before Benchmark's partner meeting.\n-   Benchmark called the Uber away while Travis was inside the Sequoia meeting, forcing him to run down San Hill Road.\n-   After the deal was done, Benchmark sent Travis a pair of Nike shoes as a fun gesture.\n-   Travis went on Jason Kilar's show on TWIST to talk about the deal.\n-   Jason Kilar asked Travis why he chose Benchmark and Travis replied that they were the best and he didn't want to work with anyone else.\n-   Other portfolio CEOs had the same opinion of Benchmark, saying they felt like a co-founder.\n-   Benchmark was involved in the \"Delete Uber\" controversy and the decision to replace Travis Kalanick as CEO.\n\n## Pressure on Benchmark\n\n-   Bill Maris started sounding the alarm in Silicon Valley about valuations being out of control and not being in the best interest of the company or founders to raise money at these valuations.\n-   Uber hit an unprecedented valuation of at least $60 billion on the private markets, which had never happened before by an order of magnitude.\n-   This created a lot of pressure on Benchmark, the board, and the LP's of Benchmark.\n-   The amount of capital involved impacted thousands of people, including employees, customers, and drivers on the platform.\n-   The pressure to land the plane and stay on the same order of magnitude of the current valuation was greater than any single relationship with a founder.\n\n## Eric Mystery Joins Benchmark\n\n-   In 2014, Benchmark brought on Eric Mystery, a non-specialist GP, as an operator and CEO.\n-   Eric was VP of Marketing at Loud Cloud and Opsware, and had worked with Ben Horowitz.\n-   Eric was an understated, yet class act, and fit the Benchmark culture.\n-   Eric's first deal was Confluent Series A, and he went on to do deals with Amplitude, Benchling, and Cerebrus.\n-   In 2017, Benchmark brought on Sarah Tavel, the first female GP at Benchmark.\n-   Sarah had worked at Bessemer, Pinterest, and Graylock.\n-   Sarah was a perfect fit for Benchmark, and her first deal was Chain Alesis, a non-consensus deal in the middle of the ICO/crypto winter.\n\n## Chathan Kudaguta Joins Benchmark\n\n-   In 2018, Benchmark brought on Chathan Kudaguta as a spec hire.\n-   Chathan had already done investments in Elastic, MuleSoft, and MongoDB, and had achieved success with all three investments.\n-   Chathan is known for his involvement in the only episode of Acquired not related to tech or business, where he and Eric analyzed the last Star Wars movie together.\n-   Chathan is a perfect example of the idea that if you are in venture for 7ish years, you can have 20 amazing years ahead of you.\n\n## Miles Grimshaw Joins Benchmark\n\n-   In 2019, Benchmark brought on Miles Grimshaw as a General Partner.\n-   Miles had previously been at Thrive Capital and was involved in helping build that firm.\n-   Miles was involved with Eric's Table and Benchling, and was very early to Benchling before Benchmark and Eric.\n-   Miles' greatest success is joining Benchmark, and he is now part of the current Benchmark partnership, which includes Peter Fenton, Eric Vessria, Sarah Tavel, Chathan Kudaguta, and Miles Grimshaw.\n\n## Discussion of Benchmark Website\n\n-   Many people know that Benchmark has a website that just says Benchmark, which has contact information linked to their Twitter feed and lists their announced portfolio companies in a Twitter list.\n-   Benchmark was the first venture capital firm to have a website in the mid-90s, and they evolved it a few times to become more modern.\n-   Matt Cohler joined the firm and worked on the website, making it more web 2.0 and interactive.\n-   The website was ultimately seen as taking credit for the entrepreneurs' success, which is antithetical to Benchmark's mission.\n-   Matt Cohler showed the website to the rest of the partnership and got a lot of feedback and opinions, ultimately leading to the decision to not have a website at all.\n-   This decision added to the mystique of Benchmark, especially in the Fab 4 era.\n\n## Discussion of Power\n\n-   Benchmark's decision to counter-position itself is a perfect illustration of power.\n-   It goes deeper than just the economics of a senior GP at a different firm having to give up a lot.\n\n## Response to Other Firms\n\n-   Other firms have had to respond competitively to Benchmark's model.\n-   In aggregate, the response has been to guarantee a good terms for the next round of funding if money is taken from Benchmark.\n-   This is true for Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Founders Fund.\n-   Unfortunately, these firms can also lead the rounds, which Benchmark cannot do.\n\n## Benchmark Model\n\n-   Benchmark has a different model than other firms, where they do not lead rounds and instead focus on helping to bring the best round together without the conflict of having to force more of their own money down the company's throat.\n-   This is beneficial for founders, as they can have a more real relationship with their board members, who are not pitching for the next round of capital.\n-   Benchmark has experimented with different types of investing, such as mezzanine investing and growth investing.\n-   They also host dinners with CEOs of companies they have missed, in order to learn why and adjust accordingly.\n\n## Grading and Other Recommendations\n\n-   It was agreed that grading should be revisited in a future episode when it makes sense to do so.\n-   Everyone was encouraged to watch Bill Gurley's talk \"Running Down a Dream\" as it is inspiring, informative, and educational.\n-   The Smart List podcast was recommended as it is entertaining and great to leave on in the background.\n-   Mitch's episode on Invest Like the Best was recommended as he is entertaining.\n-   Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series was recommended as it is very different from other science fiction.\n-   A thank you was given to Fundrise Pilot and NZ Capital.\n\n## Resources\n\n-   Links to all resources mentioned in the show notes can be found at [acquired.fm](http://acquired.fm/).\n-   To join the Zoom call in October, click the link in the show notes.\n-   To contact Fundrise, email [notvc@fundrise.com](mailto:notvc@fundrise.com).\n-   To join the Acquired Slack, visit [acquired.fm/slack](http://acquired.fm/slack).\n-   To find a job, visit [acquired.fm/jobs](http://acquired.fm/jobs).\n-   To purchase Acquired merch, visit [acquired.fm/store](http://acquired.fm/store).\n\n# Ads\n\n## Fund Rise Innovation Fund\n\n-   Ben Miller, CEO and co-founder of Fund Rise, discussed the Fund Rise Innovation Fund, which enables customers to invest in late-stage growth tech companies that are still private.\n-   Miller explained that these companies have a valuation of more than a billion dollars, and have raised money from growth funds.\n-   Miller discussed the divide between public and private markets, and how Fund Rise is working to tear down this divide by giving retail investors access to these great companies.\n-   Miller noted that two-thirds of all venture capital is Series C and later, and that retail investors are the long-term investors for these companies.\n-   Miller invited founders to email [notvc@fundrise.com](mailto:notvc@fundrise.com) to get in touch about having the Innovation Fund participate in their next funding round.","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/De-Amicitia":{"title":"De Amicitia","content":"\n[[Cicero]] wrote _De Amicitia_ at a pivotal point in his life and in history. He had spent a life devoted to Roman politics during the first century BC, a time of tremendous upheaval and civil war. By the time he had written _De Amicitia_ in 44 BC, he was in his sixties — an old man by Roman standards — living on his farm outside of Rome removed from political power by the dictatorship of Julius Caesar. The year before, he had lost his beloved daughter, Tullia, who died from complications of childbirth.\n\nAs he was a politician, I imagined that Cicero’s work would focus on the political friendships of the sort that powerful families use to establish alliances with each other, which I know were common in Cicero’s time. Indeed, many Romans saw friendship in mostly practical terms as a relationship between people for mutual advantage. MacKendrick writes in his commentary that “The word [friendship] was then, as now, most commonly employed very loosely, the broadest use of the term a stranger might be called a friend men to show goodwill.” Instead, Cicero focuses on a deeper, innate friendship driven by goodwill — he argues we ought to value friendships for their own sake. Although friendships can bring advantages, we must not seek friendships for that reason.\n\nBut what is the relationship between friendship and political allegiance? And why does Cicero completely avoid this topic in his treatise?\n\n### Things, people, places\n\n-   Pylades and Orestes - Pylades and Orestes are captured by natives of the Crimea and are sentenced to death for trying to steal an image of the goddess Artemis.\n    \n    In Pacuvius’s play, the king—who doesn’t know which man is Orestes or Pylades—orders Orestes to die, but Pylades claims to be his friend in order to save him, while Orestes maintains that he himself should die.\n    \n-   I’m rereading C.S. Lewis’s _The Four Loves_, and I am amazed by how much Cicero influenced his text. They both wrote their treatises toward the end of their lives in ill health, having suffered significant losses - Tullia for Cicero, Joy Davidman for Lewis. And they make similar claims: that the true kind of friendship is now largely lost in our world (Lewis lays out the distinctions between friendship and companionship), that the basis of friendship is a community of views and values, and that friendship is a necessity of life.","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/Educated":{"title":"Educated","content":"I’ve been recommended this book at least three times now? First my prefect, then two friends from middle school. Even before that, I had seen _Educated_ in every store and all over the internet since it came out in 2018.\n\nI have seen _Educated_ compared to J.D. Vance’s _Hillbilly Elegy_, but I don’t think Tara Westover has much in common with J.D. Vance aside from growing up in the Midwest. I certainly did not read this book as a Mormon, female J.D. Vance writing about the path slightly less taken, taking care to sugarcoat the rough parts. For me, _Educated_ was about the value and cost of a liberal arts education, and to a greater extent, its ability to liberate and alienate.\n\n---\n\nLet’s talk first about the ethical costs of receiving an education and moving up.\n\nI have also been reading Jennifer Morton’s _Moving Up Without Losing Your Way_ recently, and that definitely colored the lens through which I read _Educated._ Although I am only a fifth of the way through that book, Morton’s central thesis is as follows:\n\n\u003e Transcending the circumstances of one’s birth comes with a heavy cost felt across many aspects of our lives that we value — relationships with family and friends, our connection to our communes, and our sense of identity.\n\nI’ve seen this theme about the ethical costs of moving up across the books that I’ve read this year. In _Undocumented_, Dan-el Padilla Peralta wrote, “I’d be confronted by the differences between HarlemWorld and the Upper West, no matter how hard I tried to shut them out. The hood would come knocking—or just smash through the door.” And it’s certainly a prevalent theme in _Educated_.\n\nFor Tara, moving up comes with tremendous consequences: feelings of alienation and guilt. In several instances, Tara writes about feeling as if she had betrayed her family by leaving them behind to pursue an education, and more so to challenge the perspectives handed down by her father.\n\n\u003e I preferred the family I had chosen to the one I had been given, so the happier I became in Cambridge, the more my happiness was made fetid by my feeling that I had betrayed Buck’s Peak.\n\u003e \n\u003e Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind.\n\nAnother quote from Tara here about traveling through Europe with her Cambridge companions as a first-generation, low income (FGLI) student, or someone who is the first in her family to attend college and comes from a lower economic background:\n\n\u003e My companions moved through the city differently, aware of its significance but not subdued by it...There was a kind of symbiosis in their relationship to these grand places: they gave life to the ancient architecture by making it the backdrop of their discourse, by refusing to worship at its altar as if it were a dead thing.\n\n---\n\nThe other takeaway I had comes from the second quote, and it is about the value of the liberal arts education that I have the luxury of pursuing. In particular, these quotes spoke to me:\n\n\u003e Curiosity is a luxury reserved for the financially secure: my mind was absorbed with more immediate concerns, such as the exact balance of my bank account, who I owed how much, and whether there was anything in my room I could sell for ten or twenty dollars.\n\nThere is a lot of talk at my school about intellectual vitality and curiosity — pursuing knowledge for the sake of itself. In a similar vein, elite students are often criticized for choosing to go into banking, consulting, or finance, or for being overly focused on their careers.\n\nThis model for evaluating students doesn’t recognize that it is exhausting for financially insecure students to constantly “have curiosity.” It does not sit right with me to evaluate the character of disadvantaged groups in the same context as other privileged groups; for some, it can take as much grit to survive, as someone like me with immense privilege needed to pursue many passion projects with the confidence that I had the resources to thrive.\n\n\u003e I had discerned the ways in which we had been sculpted by a tradition given to us by others, a tradition of which we were either willfully or accidentally ignorant. I had begun to understand that we had lent our voices to a discourse whose sole purpose was to dehumanize and brutalize others— because nurturing that discourse was easier, because retaining power always feels like the way forward.\n\u003e \n\u003e In retrospect, I see that this was my education, the one that would matter: the hours I spent sitting at a borrowed desk, struggling to parse narrow strands of Mormon doctrine in mimicry of a brother who’d deserted me. The skill I was learning was a crucial one, the patience to read things I could not yet understand.\n\nTara showed that a liberal arts education is so much more than curiosity and intellectual exploration alone; it is more than thriving in the pursuits of inglorious leisure (_studiis florentem ignobilis oti_, Virgil, Georgics 4.564). Being educated means having the courage to learn and unlearn, questioning what we have been taught, and being patient enough to read things we cannot yet understand.","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/Exhalation":{"title":"Exhalation","content":"\nBefore diving in, some life updates first: I just moved to California last week. I think I like it here. The weather suits me. The people I work with are generous, brilliant, and humble. I feel a sense of purpose again, and after sixteen months at home, the change of scenery has definitely helped. That said, it’s now 1 am, and I still haven’t slept (r.i.p. my sleep schedule, again).\n\nI first picked up this book at Kinokuniya in New York last February, the month before everything changed. There, I started reading “The Merchant at the Alchemist’s Gate.” I can’t help but compare all the science fiction I read these days to Ken Liu. Ted Chiang is more philosophical but less literary; his fiction reads a bit like “The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species.”\n\nThese stories touch on many themes: cognition; free will; love; time; memory; humanity’s search for meaning. I confess that I didn’t fully understand these stories, especially they are so rich. Considering that I essentially pulled an all-nighter reading this book (and that was last week), there are many details from this book that I don’t remember. But I think my favorite stories from this collection were “The Merchant at the Alchemist’s Gate,” “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” “The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling,” and “Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom.”\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n-   If we are able to revisit the past but not change it, which is something we are able to do now, we can only grow from remembering the good or forgiving ourselves and others.\n    \n-   Truth is subjective. The narratives we create will change with the adoption of digital or artificial remembrance - even things like taking videos and photographs, recording conversations on Zoom or Otter.ai, and using smart glasses like Google Glass or Snapchat Lens. Ted Chiang made a really astute observation when he wrote, “Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we’ve lived; they’re the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments.” In a sense, writing, or any documentation, is a form of artificial remembrance. As technology evolves, our recall will, too. Storytelling might look different (or require different mediums), but it will nonetheless continue to exist.\n    \n-   To love is to sacrifice. This strikes me as a very Chinese value, and it’s certainly how I conceive of my love for my parents (the only real love I have felt yet) or the love they have for each other. It is about a willingness to expend effort. Love isn’t _Breakfast at Tiffany’s_ - it’s what I see in the life that my parents have built for my brother and me; making up after an argument, doing chores together, finding pleasure in the little things (a good meal, a good conversation), sharing trust. That is the love I want to build one day for my family.\n    \n-   On digital memory: I’m brought back to Ken Liu’s The Paper Menagerie, where he explores similar themes.\n    \n    \u003e We are now a race of cyborgs. We long ago began to spread our minds into the electronic realm, and it is no longer possible to squeeze all of ourselves back into our brains. The electronic copies of yourselves that you wanted to destroy are, in a literal sense, actually you.\n    \n    And this:\n    \n    \u003e Churchill said that we shape our buildings, and afterward our buildings shape us. We made machines to help us think, and now the machines think for us.\n    \n    Here is Liu’s commentary:\n    \n    \u003e The first person in recorded history to make this argument was arguably Plato, who, in Phaedrus, cautioned against writing: “This discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves.” We now know that Plato was at least partly right. Literacy has fundamentally altered the way we wield language and think, and even our oral expressions now are steeped in literary devices. (For more on this topic, I recommend Walter J. Ong’s Orality and Literacy.)\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I don’t know how our consciousness will be altered by ever-tighter coupling with our technologies. I don’t think that’s inherently a negative development. As a technologist and programmer, I have a natural affinity for the idea that **the brain can write code and code can also rewrite the brain**. Writing has made us **both more and less human**, and perhaps these cognition-enhancing machines will do the same.\n    \n\n### 💬 Quotes that stuck\n\n-   “Instead, he asked young Hassan to remind him of the pranks he had played as a child, and he laughed to hear stories that had faded from his own memory.”\n    \n-   “Like infernal fire, grief burns but does not consume; instead, it makes the heart vulnerable to further suffering.”\n    \n-   “Four things do not come back: the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity.”\n    \n-   “Past and future are the same, and we cannot change either, only know them more fully. My journey to the past had changed nothing, but what I had learned had changed everything, and I understood that it could not have been otherwise. If our lives are tales that Allah tells, then we are the audience as well as the players, and it is by living these tales that we receive their lessons.”\n    \n-   “Nothing erases the past. There is repentance, there is atonement, and there is forgiveness. That is all, but that is enough.”\n    \n-   “I hope that you were motivated by a desire for knowledge, a yearning to see what can arise from a universe’s exhalation. Because even if a universe’s life span is calculable, the variety of life that is generated within it is not. The buildings we have erected, the art and music and verse we have composed, the very lives we’ve led: none of them could have been predicted, because none of them was inevitable. Our universe might have slid into equilibrium emitting nothing more than a quiet hiss. The fact that it spawned such plenitude is a miracle, one that is matched only by your universe giving rise to you.”\n    \n-   “Like a legion of Bartleby the scriveners, they no longer engage in spontaneous action.”\n    \n-   “The issue wasn’t confined to marriages; all sorts of relationships rely on forgiving and forgetting.”\n    \n-   “People are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we’ve lived; they’re the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments.”\n    \n-   “He had come to trust what was written on paper over what was said by people, and that wasn’t the Tiv way.”\n    \n-   “As someone whose identity was built on organic memory, I’m threatened by the prospect of removing subjectivity from our recall of events. I used to think it could be valuable for individuals to tell stories about themselves, valuable in a way that it couldn’t be for cultures, but I’m a product of my time, and times change. We can’t prevent the adoption of digital memory any more than oral cultures could stop the arrival of literacy, so the best I can do is look for something positive in it.”\n    \n-   “It’s no coincidence that “aspiration” means both hope and the act of breathing. When we speak, we use the breath in our lungs to give our thoughts a physical form. The sounds we make are simultaneously our intentions and our life force. I speak, therefore I am. Vocal learners, like parrots and humans, are perhaps the only ones who fully comprehend the truth of this.”\n    \n-   “Sex isn’t what makes a relationship real; the willingness to expend effort maintaining it is. Some lovers break up with each other the first time they have a big argument; some parents do as little for their children as they can get away with; some pet owners ignore their pets whenever they become inconvenient…It’s similar to the way movies always depict love in terms of grand romantic gestures when, over the long term, love also means working through money problems and picking dirty laundry off the floor.”","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/Folding-Beijing":{"title":"Folding Beijing","content":"This book is pleasantly short, but it made me think about Yuval Noah Harari’s so-called ‘useless class.’ Harari argues that in the aftermath of the AI revolution, “just as mass industrialization created the working class, the AI revolution will create a new unworking class.” The useless class will be composed of people working jobs that can easily be automated.\n\nIn particular, a couple of quotes made me pause:\n\n\u003e 人工成本往上涨，机器成本往下降，到一定时候就\n\u003e \n\u003e 是机器便宜，生产力一改造，升级了，GDP上去了，失业也上去了。怎么办？政策保护？福利？**越保护工厂越不雇人。**\n\nI don’t know enough about economics to judge if this statement is true, but I know that this is a problem first-world countries face. The high cost of American labor has led to the importation of overseas labor; now, the millions who have lost their livelihoods and their foothold on the middle class have also lost the sense of hope that accompanies their work. There is something fulfilling about work — knowing that we are useful anchors us and saves us from becoming spiritually adrift.\n\nAnd this one:\n\n\u003e 他们埋头斧凿，用累累砖块将自己包围在中间，抬起头来也看不见天空，沙尘遮挡视线，他们不知晓自己建起的是怎样的恢弘。直到建成的日子高楼如活人一般站立而起，他们才像惊呆了一样四处奔逃，仿佛自己生下了一个怪胎。\n\n码农不也这样吗？Who here even knows what we are building, what exactly we are toiling for? The cogs in the machine are parts of the whole, but the whole is invisible to them.\n\nThis book made me pause and wonder about my role in the world. As an investor, I’m betting on the acceleration of technology, and automation in particular. I see AI eating into the working class (autonomous driving, check-out, customer service) and middle class (think of all the knowledge tasks that ChatGPT can do). Today, my friend Julian told me about the sense of wonder he felt upon learning about the Bing and ChatGPT integration. And there is always a sense of wonder that accompanies new technology, because it pushes our imagination for what is possible. After reading this book, I’m thinking of [Christopher Caldwell](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Entitlement-America-Since-Sixties/dp/1501106899)’s warning about winners and losers in any economy. There will always be a human cost to change, however positive that change may be.","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/Holiday-Special-2022":{"title":"Holiday Special 2022","content":"\n- [[Taylor Swift]]\n\t- Why is it that Taylor Swift is bigger than the Beatles?

At graduation they had plans and visions for what they would accomplish, not just in their careers, but in their personal lives as well. Yet something had gone wrong for some of them along the way: their personal relationships had begun to deteriorate, even as their professional prospects blossomed. I sensed that they felt embarrassed to explain to their friends the contrast in the trajectories of their personal and professional lives.\n\nI read this book toward the end of the summer, during a time in my life when I felt confused about many things. For months, I have felt burnt out about the so-called “entrepreneurial ecosystem” at Stanford. In September, it felt nice to be away from Stanford for a bit when I was home with my family. Now I’m back in the thick of it all - biking frantically from place to place, having more people to meet than I have time for, doing the mental calculus of figuring out where to be, and desperately wanting to be in two places at once.\n\nThe truth is that [[Stanford]] is a daunting place. I was reading the transcript of an AOPS session with college advice. The question posed was an interesting one: “What are some of the main ways that smart / high achieving kids fail once they get to Stanford? And what is the main advice you'd have for preventing (or recovering) from that failure?” The student gave an insightful answer:\n\n\u003e There are definitely new challenges here that can be hard to adapt to, such as the fact that you're suddenly surrounded by many more brilliant people, and the classes are much harder but also often more flexible, with the result that you're responsible for keeping yourself on schedule and not falling behind…accept that things are going to be harder now and that this is a good thing.\n\nNo one at Stanford is mediocre or unmotivated. And when everyone around you is brilliant, thriving, and working incredibly hard, it is very easy to feel inadequate. It is equally easy to get competitive about the wrong things.\n\nAnd I think that’s the audience Christensen writes for — people who are doing so much that they lose track of what really matters. Reading _How Will You Measure Your Life_ felt grounding. It’s a crazy hodgepodge of a book with one main idea but so many smaller takeaways. I think this book would have transformed my parents’ lives had they read it in their twenties and early thirties, and I’m glad to be reading it now.\n\n### #1: Apply management science to life.\n\nIt feels jarring to see such blurred lines between running a business and a family - but that’s the approach Christensen takes to his writing. I would read a case about a steel mill and then some personal anecdote on the value of integrity.\n\nHe argues that studying cases and theories provides not only a static snapshot, but also rich stories (story templates?) that are generalizable.\n\n\u003e “You can replace the actors in our movies — different people, companies, and industries — and watch the movie again. You can choose the actions that these actors take in the movie. Because the plots in these movies are grounded in theories of causality, however, the results of these actions are perfectly predictable.” (208)\n\nWhereas anecdotes and experiences reflect correlation, theories reflect causality. Theories are a more effective method of learning because they are not reliant on past experiences — they help us categorize events; understand why and how things happen; predict what problems and opportunities will occur and what actions to take. It makes sense that theories describing management can also teach us about success and happiness in our lives.\n\n### #2: There are some things which you can be uncertain about — what Christensen terms emergent strategy — and other things for which you must have from the outset (purpose, or at least the likeness of one)\n\n“Occasionally, the actual strategy maps quite closely with what we intended. But often what we actually end up doing is very different from what we set out to do.”\n\nValues, culture - these things matter so much in organizations and in our lives\n\nChristensen is a very principled person.

Money is not the primary motivator.\n    \n    -   _Principal-agent_, or _incentives_ theory: people work in accordance with how you pay them.

That way, if the stock goes up, executives are compensated better, and it makes both shareholders and executives happy.\n        \n    -   _Two-factor theory_, or _motivation theory_: you can pay people to want what you want—over and over again. But incentives are not the same as motivation. True motivation is getting people to do something because they want to do it. This type of motivation continues, in good times and in bad.”\n        \n    -   Herzberg: satisfaction and dissatisfaction are separate, independent measures. It’s possible to love your job and hate it at the same time.\n        \n        -   hygiene factors: status, compensation, job security, work conditions, company policies, and supervisory practices; if not done right, these will cause us to be dissatisfied\n            \n        -   motivation factors: challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth. “Feelings that you are making a meaningful contribution to work arise from intrinsic conditions of the work itself. Motivation is much less about external prodding or stimulation, and much more about what’s inside of you, and inside of your work”\n            \n    -   “It is hard to overestimate the power of these motivators—the feelings of accomplishment and of learning, of being a key player on a team that is achieving something meaningful. I shudder to think that I almost bought a kit from which I could have quickly assembled the playhouse myself.”\n        \n\n### 💬 Quotes that stuck\n\n-   “When people ask me something, I now rarely answer directly. Instead, I run the question through a theory in my own mind, so I know what the theory says is likely to be the result of one course of action, compared to another. I’ll then explain how it applies to their question. To be sure they understand it, I’ll describe to them how the process in the model worked its way through an industry or situation different from their own, to help them visualize how it works. People, typically, then say, “Okay, I get it.” They’ll then answer their question with more insight than I could possibly have.”\n    \n-   “The only way to be truly satisfied is to **do what you believe is great work**. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.” - Steve Jobs\n    \n-   “Money is [not] the root cause of professional unhappiness. The problems start occurring when it becomes the priority over all else, when hygiene factors are satisfied but the quest remains only to make more money.”\n    \n-   “If you want to help other people, be a manager. If done well, management is among the most noble of professions… you have eight or ten hours every day from every person who works for you. You have the opportunity to frame each person’s work so that, at the end of every day, your employees will go home feeling like [they are] living a life filled with motivators.”\n    \n\n### ⁉️ Questions I’m still pondering:\n\nThis book was chock full of great questions.\n\n**The basics: How will you measure your life?**\n\n-   How can I be sure that I will be successful and happy in my career?\n    \n-   How can my relationships with my spouse, my children, and my extended family and close friends become an enduring source of happiness?\n    \n-   Can I live a life of integrity—and stay out of jail?\n    \n\n**How do you find work you will love?**\n\n-   What’s most important to you in your career?\n    \n-   In your life, there are going to be constant demands for your time and attention.

In his critique of the university, Bloom focuses on the institution's specialization of knowledge and its culture of moral relativism. He asserts that the university has become too focused on vocational training, rather than providing a well-rounded education that fosters critical thinking and intellectual curiosity. This narrow focus has led to a loss of cultural and moral values, promoting a shallow worldview that undermines the very foundations of liberal education. It is worth revisiting Bloom's critiques since the book was written nearly forty years ago because of how pertinent and prescient they are at a university like [[Stanford]], which has “acquired a reputation as a place for people more interested in careers or targeted education than in a lofty ‘search for truth’” (Auletta).\n\nBloom is not thinking about the value of a university, but rather its fundamental purpose. Stanford falls short in all the ways that he describes – the university siloes students into narrow disciplines, and students care more about money than intellectual pursuits. Bloom believes that by merely providing students with a narrow set of professional skills, the modern university fails to fulfill the ultimate purpose of education — nurturing students intellectually and aiding in the development of the whole self. Bloom argues that offering career preparation without humanistic learning limits students’ ability to see the world they are in. \n\n\u003e “The impression of our general populace is better educated depends on ambiguity in the meaning of the word education, or a fudging of the distinction between liberal and technical education. A highly trained computer specialist need not have had any more learning about morals, politics, or religion than the most ignorant of persons. _All to the contrary, his narrow education, with the prejudices and the pride accompanying it, and its literature which comes to be and passes away in a day and uncritically accepts the premises of current wisdom, can cut him off from the liberal learning that simpler folk used to absorb from a variety of traditional sources_” (Bloom 59).\n\nWe have received wisdom that we should take seriously and specialists are neglecting – that students’ ignorance of history, literature, and the Western canon leads to a loss of perspective. Bloom distinguishes between holding a professional degree and having intellectual depth, commenting that how his relatives who have doctoral degrees can express “nothing but cliches, superficialities, and the materials of satire [when they] talk about heaven and earth, the relations between men and women, parents and children, the human condition” (Bloom 60).\n\nIn Bloom’s view, the university should be a sanctuary where students can question and contemplate, where one can pursue knowledge “free from constraints as to sources and fields” (Casper)**.** The university is meant to open up options for fields you are meant to explore but not tell you what to explore. A liberal arts core curriculum should not push you in a single direction, but rather send you multiple directions.\n\nStanford, however, falls short of Bloom’s ambitions, in part because of how intertwined research and industry are for its faculty and students. From its inception, Stanford pledged to “provide an education that led to ‘personal success and direct usefulness in life,’ a head-on critique of East Coast schools whose students ‘acquire a university degree or fashionable educational veneer for the mere ornamentation of idle and purposeless lives’” (Cohen, 52). Unlike Bloom’s university, which advocated pursuing knowledge for its own sake, Stanford sought to make knowledge useful. Maintaining Stanford’s industry connections means that more money is funneled to economically fruitful fields, which often tend to be technical fields like engineering rather than the humanities. Although the outsized success of these companies has brought economic boon and opportunities for the university — and the wealth has flowed back to Stanford as revenue from licensing inventions and donations from wealthy alumni — they have limited what students are able and willing to explore. Consequently, fewer students engage in the kind of learning and truth-seeking that Bloom claims are critical to the health of a democratic society.\n\nBeginning with Frederick Terman, who became the dean of the Stanford School of Engineering after the Second World War and the provost in 1955, Stanford encouraged collaboration between academia and industry, helping students and faculty members convert research into business opportunities. (Cohen, 49). Terman believed that “the university is a real asset if you make use of it—industrial use. And then I would come back and beat on the backs of the professors to get out and get acquainted with those companies that were related to their research” (Cohen 11). As a professor, Terman negotiated for radio companies to donate equipment to his lab so students could carry out practical scientific work (Cohen, 62). He also encouraged two of his students, William Hewlett and David Packard, to commercialize a line of audio oscillators that became the first product of the Hewlett-Packard Company (Auletta). Hewlett and Packard is now one of the thousands of companies traceable to Stanford ideas or faculty and students; others include major players in the tech industry such as [[Google]], [[Sun Microsystems]], and [[Cisco]] Systems (Auletta). Under Terman's guidance, Stanford has become a hub for the information economy. Since 1970, Stanford University has licensed 3,500 inventions in a variety of fields, resulting in around $1.5 billion in revenue. In 2004, the university received $336 million for its stake in Google, which was granted in exchange for a license for the search technology developed by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as Stanford students (Cohen, 66).\n\nIn the process of laying the business ties between Stanford and Silicon Valley, Terman steered Stanford toward lucrative research areas: academic disciplines which were more likely to generate business opportunities and government grants (Cohen, 49). Terman shifted the biology department away from its strength in zoology and toward laboratory research, which could be commercialized more easily (Cohen, 50). Terman also shrunk the classics department by failing to replace two professors who had retired (Cohen, 50). Under Terman’s philosophy, it did not make sense to invest Stanford’s resources in a field with such a small potential payoff.\n\nBeyond university directives, the limitations to intellectual exploration also come from the students themselves, who collide because of the orientation of the university itself and the peer pressure that it produces. Silicon Valley has provided opportunities and possibilities for Stanford students, but it has also fostered a culture that defines the good for the people within it. Because of the strong financial incentives, students are less willing to question the culture associated with it, creating “a gold-rush mentality and where the distinction between faculty and student may blur as, together, they seek both invention and fortune” (Auletta). \n\nStanford’s business ties with [[Silicon Valley]] and focus on wealth creation have resulted in a number of spoken and unspoken cultural artifacts that are worth questioning, including an ideology of techno-solutionism and capitalism. Cohen writes, “There is, of course, a distinct Silicon Valley belief system… it advocates for a highly individualistic society led by the smartest people, who deliver wonderful gadgets and platforms for obtaining goods, services, and information efficiently, freeing each of us to compete in the marketplace for our daily bread” (Cohen, 9). There are several underlying assumptions: that we can solve societal problems by starting technology companies, that these companies are doing good for society, and that we should allow the people who start those companies to lead, all of which bring to mind Bloom’s description of Laputa from _Gulliver’s Travels_, which is an island ruled by natural scientists. Like the Laputians, the lopsided engineering education that Stanford students receive renders them less capable of questioning the world they are creating: “They are perfect Cartesians—one egotistical eye contemplating the self, one cosmological eye surveying the most distant things” (Bloom, 294). They are so focused on their own advancement and their work that it is difficult to pay attention to everything in between. And Bloom warns presciently that “the scientists exploit the nonscientists so as to live their version of the contemplative life in safety and comfort.” He writes,\n\n\u003e “More simply put, Swift says that the scientists in power and with power don’t give a damn about mankind at large. The whole conspiracy is like any other. The potential tyrant speaks in the name of the common good but is seeking a private good” (Bloom, 295). \n\nSilicon Valley is known for its hordes of entrepreneurs who are committed to “making the world a better place” — and its scions have become more than scientists. The ubiquity of technology they produce has transformed them into civic and economic leaders who have the wealth and power to shape America’s values. It is all the more important to heed Bloom’s vision for a university’s purpose: to help students cultivate independent thinking, to teach students to search for the truth rather than accepting everything at face value, especially within a cloistered environment. \n\nHowever, Bloom’s argument has its flaws. Bloom’s critiques have a nostalgia for when universities were only open to the wealthy, who don’t need practical skills or training. He insinuates this when he designates “the small band of prestigious institutions” to provide liberal education and relegates big state schools “to prepare specialists to meet the practical demands of a complex society” (Bloom 341). College admissions are competitive, the cost of tuition is high, and given economic uncertainty, students often naturally prioritize majors that are likely to lead to job prospects (Auletta). \n\nAs much as I was drawn by its idealism, I could not have survived in Bloom’s ivory tower. When I read Bloom, I think about the first conversation I had with Russell when I came to Stanford. He told me that what I wanted to study – computer science and classical languages – merely provided vocational skills. Learning how to code or translate Latin is different from learning how to think. Growing up with immigrant parents who are technical workers, I was never able to shed my fear of not being able to feed myself if I only study the liberal arts, without a more practical pursuit. But I was obstinate, and I wanted both. If anything, it is not possible to find answers to the broad questions that Bloom extols – to search for a good life, to understand themselves and the grounds of their changing society, to form a vision of the public good - if we only read the Great Books and are ignorant of how technology impacts our lives. If that were the case, what little understanding we have of the world would be grounded in the abstract, and we’d be no better than Swift’s Laputans: so absorbed in their study that they are removed from the human experience. \n\nThinking about Bloom’s critiques and their limitations has informed my thinking on how I want to spend the rest of my time in college. I realize now that I can distinguish between the institution and its culture – that I can take advantage of the opportunities of Silicon Valley without buying into its values. I want to worry less about the supposed binary of liberal arts versus vocational education and focus on nourishing my soul intellectually.","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/The-Hidden-Girl":{"title":"The Hidden Girl","content":"\nYesterday, I went to a webinar featuring Ken Liu, in which he talked about the value of stories. According to Liu, stories are maps for what it means to live a good life, to be fully human.\n\nAs humans, we are guided by a need for self-definition and self narrative. We want to be surrounded by objects of meaning, to know that we made a dent in the universe or brought joy to someone’s life. Liu argues that this kind of tangible, “putting ourselves out there into the world” is at the core of storytelling and technology. Writing is a technology we invented to share our thoughts, and technology is about putting our cognition out into the world. We are continuously trying to make sense of our lives by telling a story of who we are and how we came to be. We make our values real by enacting them and turning them into stories.\n\nSo unlike the other authors I’ve enjoyed recently, like Ocean Vuong or Chen Chen, it’s not the writing in _The Hidden Girl_ that makes it so beautiful, but the ideas encapsulated within the text. It’s the intricacy of the narrative, the thought experiments each story represents. These stories hover in an uncanny valley of being fantastic enough to strike fear and real enough to be plausible. After all, singularity is not a question of if, but when. As I raced through these stories, I found myself pondering questions about morality and mortality.\n\n-   A criminal who murders may still be a good father, husband, brother, and son - must we punish the whole person? Can we separate a person from his or her crimes? To what extent is each of us more than the worst thing we’ve done? (“The Reborn”)\n    \n-   How accurate is photographic representation? Can we substitute an online conscience for reality? How much should social media companies moderate content? Should they have the power of arbiters of truth and decency for an entire society? (“Thoughts and Prayers”)\n    \n-   How we can continue to make the world a better place when policy is tempered by realism? Can we commoditize suffering for a noble goal? (“Byzantine Empathy”)\n    \n-   When we do reach singularity, what is the right way to live, and what is the right way to die? Does the authenticity of our messy existence, including pain and suffering, make us human? (“Staying Behind”)\n    \n\nReading _The Hidden Girl_ once again helped me appreciate technology as an artistic process of taking existing tropes and putting them together to solve new problems. This is the message Liu left his readers with at the webinar: “Engineering is the most important art we know how to practice as a species, a way to explain to the universe who we are. But in the end, storytelling is how we give ourselves hope, the strength to climb up and to keep on going.”","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/The-Paper-Menagerie":{"title":"The Paper Menagerie","content":"\nThis book is stunning.

This book made me feel proud to be Chinese-American - to have the cultural legacy of two of the most powerful and storied countries in the world; it made me fall in love with Cambridge all over again (see you in four years?); it helped me see the broad connections between ethics and technology.  \n  \nI think that’s the beauty of science fiction - by building worlds that do not yet exist, we are preparing ourselves for them.

Julian and I are almost four months in. I don’t think I have ever felt so cared for, supported by, or attracted to someone. For now, at least, I’m too afraid to think about the messiness and pain.\n\nI thought a lot about this quote from Jake:\n\n\u003e Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.\n\nI don’t really know what Hemingway is saying here. This is what Tianyu said:\n\n\u003e I think I identify with Jake Barnes in the sense that he knows full well that he wants something he can’t get — in his case, being with Brett Ashley because he’s impotent — and makes peace with it. Jake loves Brett in a way that he doesn’t have to be with her, but to be around for her despite what must’ve been humiliating circumstances (which Hemingway seems to downplay?)\n\nI think maybe I interpreted it in a totally different way - can heterosexual women and men form true friendships? Is there some hidden obligation that I am not aware of? Tianyu says that behind the facade of friendship is romantic feelings, which both know isn’t possible. I want to disagree with this. I feel happy with Julian, but I value my friendships with Jack and Tianyu because I share interests with them, no longer because I want to be with them. I feel like Hemingway’s implication here is kind of sexist.\n\nBrett reminds me of Milan Kundera’s idea of lightness. I’m thinking about Hemingway and his friends living on the West Bank. Their lives felt so reckless, so light, in the Kundera sense. They bet hundreds of euros on bullfights and then starve for five days, another fifty euros on a girl who might call. And that was a hundred years ago — so these amounts aren’t even inflation-adjusted. It all feels so foreign and so heretical to me, even though I sometimes find myself craving the same freedom.\n\nI know that I can spend hours analyzing the symbols of the false titles - the European aristocracy (like Brett and Mike) who are impoverished and the nouveau rice Americans who are now buying their way in. But at the surface level, all I see is a bunch of people burning money in France and Spain.

You worry about little things, can’t pinpoint where you are in any objective way, become really proficient at strange, pointless skills, and are held in thrall by inexplicable complexes. As you get older, though, through trial and error you learn to get what you need, and throw out what should be discarded.

I guess that when I chose Stanford at seventeen, I didn’t realize how much it would impact my value system and my career path. I was telling mom on the phone the other day that I really let VCs determine my sense of self-worth. Why is someone who codes well and maybe thinks mediocrely worth their investment, and not someone like me, who thinks well and codes mediocrely? I’ve felt so pained by their evaluation criteria that I’ve overhauled my college major multiple times: from computer science to classics to science, technology, and society, and now back to computer science. I can’t tell if I’m living my life in a way that aligns more with others’ expectations than my own, and honestly, I’ve felt this way for the past two years. I can’t tell if I’m throwing away everything I’m good at to chase this elusive goal of becoming better at engineering. Maybe I am.\n\nBut I can talk about some things that have brought me joy recently. I have felt joy going down rabbit holes on Curius. This week, I have been reading Ethan Kurzweil’s [Developer Laws](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/developer-laws-2019?curius=2055), looking at [Oscar Dumlao’s portfolio](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/developer-laws-2019?curius=2055) (he’s the designer behind Marriage Pact, Ladder, Skiff - basically the only legit-ish startups that have emerged from Stanford’s student startup scene), various writing on dev tooling — Github, Netlify, Replit, Vercel, Mark Andreesen’s blogs from the early 2000s. I have felt joy playing with NextUI elements for my little VC/founder matching tool. I’m thinking about how you can only have intuition for a product (or anything, really) if you use it yourself.\n\nWhat excites me?\n\n-   I’m excited about how technology can help us think better, and together. Curius is a great example of this.\n    \n    [1](https://lindasbookshelf.substack.com/p/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about#footnote-1-107489660)\n    \n     Every day, I feel inspired by what my peers are reading and thinking about. What if we have more social reading tools? What if something like Curius were integrated into iBooks and Kindle (Wechat Reading already does this, to some extent)? What if technology can help us unearth connections between our thoughts (and what we have read)? Sure, Omni is doing this, and Mem, Roam, and others are attempting to as well, but I haven’t found anything that feels joyful and intuitive to use. Is there a way to non-mechanically “port my brain,” some visual mind place that you can play with and edit?\n    \n-   I’m excited by reading. I enjoy thinking about the past and how it maps onto the future. I like reading about past financial crises, boom and bust cycles, legendary tech companies that changed how we live. I like thinking about risk and strategy — how do you mitigate risk? When do you walk away? How do you put yourself in the right place at the right time?\n    \n-   I’m excited by beautiful interfaces and experiences. I not only want to invest in those who are building them, but also build them myself, and build tools for the people who are building them. If any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, I want to become the magician’s apprentice.\n    \n\nI’m writing all of this down because there are a lot of days when I lose hope. My conviction in myself and what I love ebbs and flows, and writing is the best way for me to bottle those feelings. I remind myself that twenty-one is so young, that I really have the opportunity to **learn** whatever I want to if I put my _heart_ to it. I remind myself that love can be learned, and that it can come gradually.  \n  \nI’m proud of myself for not treating Stanford as a place where I must do what I excel at, but just as I would any other school. I’m here to learn, grow, nourish my curiosity. And I’m doing that right now.","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null},"/notes/config":{"title":"Configuration","content":"\n## Configuration\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Linda Tong\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz. More info in issue #109 on GitHub\nenableSPA: true\n\n# whether to render a footer\nenableFooter: true\n\n# whether backlinks of pages should show the context in which\n# they were mentioned\nenableContextualBacklinks: true\n\n# whether to show a section of recent notes on the home page\nenableRecentNotes: false\n\n# whether to display an 'edit' button next to the last edited field\n# that links to github\nenableGitHubEdit: true\nGitHubLink: https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/hugo/content\n\n# whether to render mermaid diagrams\nenableMermaid: true\n\n# whether to use Operand to power semantic search\n# IMPORTANT: replace this API key with your own if you plan on using\n# Operand search!\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: false\n  operandApiKey: \"REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OPERAND-API-KEY\"\n  operandIndexId: \"REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OPERAND-INDEX-ID\"\n\n# page description used for SEO\ndescription:\n  Host your second brain and digital garden for free. Quartz features extremely fast full-text search,\n  Wikilink support, backlinks, local graph, tags, and link previews.\n\n# title of the home page (also for SEO)\npage_title:\n  \"🪴 Linda's Garden\"\n\n# links to show in the footer\nlinks:\n  - link_name: Twitter\n    link: https://twitter.com/lktong_\n  - link_name: Github\n    link: https://github.com/lindaktong\n```\n\n### Code Block Titles\nTo add code block titles with Quartz:\n\n1. Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T00:55:49.059072479Z","tags":null}}
